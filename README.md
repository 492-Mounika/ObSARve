# üõ∞Ô∏è ObSARve ‚Äì Accelerating Earth‚Äôs Vision with SAR and FPGA

### NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025  
**Challenge:** *Like Alice in Wonderland ‚Äì Down the Radar Rabbit Hole*  
**Team:** ObSARve  
**Study Area:** Gangotri Glacier, Uttarakhand, India  

---

## üåç Overview

**ObSARve** is a project designed to enhance the analysis and processing of **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** data for environmental monitoring and climate studies.  
Our focus area is the **Gangotri Glacier**, one of the primary sources of the Ganges River. Using **NASA ASF Vertex** data from **2017, 2020, and 2024**, we analyzed glacier surface variations over time and proposed a **hardware-accelerated (FPGA) pipeline** for real-time SAR data processing.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze **multi-temporal SAR data** to study glacier surface changes.  
- Develop an efficient **preprocessing and visualization workflow** using NASA data.  
- Implement the same processing pipeline on **FPGA hardware** for faster and energy-efficient computation.  
- Explore **real-time or onboard processing** potential for **UAVs or satellites**.

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Source: **NASA ASF Vertex (Sentinel-1 SAR SLC data)**  
- Years analyzed: **2017, 2020, and 2024**  
- Region of Interest: **Gangotri Glacier, Uttarakhand, India**

### 2. **Preprocessing Workflow (Python + SNAP)**

- SLC ‚Üí TIFF ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Image/GIF ‚Üí Analysis
  
- Converted `.SLC` data to `.TIFF` using **ESA SNAP Toolbox**
- Applied **radiometric calibration**, **terrain correction**, and **speckle filtering**
- Processed and visualized using:
  - **Python** libraries: Rasterio, Matplotlib, NumPy, GDAL  
  - Generated **GIFs** and **Google Earth overlays** for temporal change detection

### 3. **FPGA Implementation (Proposed and Partially Built)**
- TIFF ‚Üí SD Card ‚Üí MicroBlaze ‚Üí DMA ‚Üí FPGA Kernel ‚Üí Processed Data ‚Üí Image/GIF
  
We designed an **FPGA-based system architecture** in **Xilinx Vivado** to accelerate SAR preprocessing.  
Current progress includes:
- Integration of **MicroBlaze processor**, **DMA**, and **memory components** in Vivado  
- Planning of a **custom FPGA kernel** for SAR data processing  

Due to time constraints during the hackathon, the full computational pipeline is yet to be implemented.  
However, the system design establishes a solid foundation for **real-time SAR data processing** and **hardware-based acceleration**, which we aim to complete in the future.
