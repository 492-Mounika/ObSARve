## ðŸ¤– Use of AI

- The **initial scripts and all subsequent adjustments** were guided by **ChatGPT**, which provided advice on:  
  - SAR preprocessing steps  
  - Python libraries and functions  
  - Code structure and workflow  
  - Customizations for visualization and GIF generation  

- While AI provided guidance, all **decisions, implementation choices, and final adaptations** were made by our team to match the specific needs of the ObSARve project.  

This approach acknowledges AI assistance while highlighting our **original thought, execution, and project-specific design** in line with NASA Space Apps policies.
